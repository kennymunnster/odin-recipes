        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You may think of duck gizzards as the nasty bits, but they are a little-understood gem that often goes underappreciated outside of France. While you may think of duck confit and foix 
            gras as the pinnacle of cultured duck cuisine, the truth is these tiny little organs are <strong>by far</strong> the most delicious bite the animal has to offer!</p>

            <p>They can be enjoyed on their own, but I highly recommend to do as the Parisians do and toss them in with some healthy greens, drizzle with some vinegar, and <em>bon apetit!</em>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs large duck gizzards</li>
            <li>2 tsp coarse kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot, <em>chopped</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp lightly crused black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp dried tyme leaves or herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>4 cups rendered duck fat</li>
            <li>6 oz mixed greens</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Salt, <em>to taste</em></li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and pat dry the gizzards. Cut away extraneous fat and membranes.</li>
            <li>Combine the gizzards with salt, shallots, garlic, peppercorns, and herbs. Cover with plastic wrap and cure in the fridge overnight, up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Rinse the gizzards and place in a small to medium pot. Melt the fat and pour over the gizzards and heat on low. Heat the fat slowly over 40 minutes to a temperature
                of 225 degrees Farenheit. The fat should be barely simmering, otherwise you may overcook and toughen the gizzards. Cook for 2-3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the gizzards. Use at once or store in glass jars with enough fat to submerge the gizzards and refrigerate. Gizzards keep up to 2 weeks in the fridge. When 
                removing from the fridge, bring the jars to room temperature or steam to soften the fat and remove the gizzards. The fat can be reserved for use in cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Thinly slice the gizzards and heat in a skillet with a few teaspoons of duck fat on low, for 2-3 minutes. Remove gizzards and add to salad greens.</li>
            <li>Pour vinegar and Dijon mustard if desired into the skillet to deglaze and pour the contents of the skillet over the salad and toss. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
