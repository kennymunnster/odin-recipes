            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add egg yolks and water to a small frying pan and hold 2 inches above a medium-high element. Whisk the eggs until they are fronthy and warm.
                Add the butter to the pan and whisk until the hollandaise is thick. Whisk in the lemon juice and a pinch of salt and set the pan aside.
            </li>

            <li>Toast the muffins and spread cream cheese on top. Divide the smoked salmon between them.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce the water heat so that it gently simmers. Crack the eggs one at a time and cook for 4 minutes. Remove using a slotted 
                spoon and place one on each muffin.
            </li>
